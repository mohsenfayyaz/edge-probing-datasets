Note that the full economic argument has two parts, each of which is conveniently neglected by pro-and anti-gun crusaders: on the one hand, gun control does increase the cost of having guns (including black market prices) and, therefore, does prevent some criminals from getting them; on the other hand, gun control increases the cost for honest citizens of protecting themselves with guns.", "id": "2378650", "targetConcept": "CONTROL_OF_GUNS", "type": "ANNOTATOR_EXAMPLES", "chain": "*:nsubj", "targets": [{"span1": [27, 28], "span2": [25, 26], "span1_word": "imposes", "span2_word": "gun control", "label": "2.0"}]}
