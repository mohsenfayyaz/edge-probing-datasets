Information retrieval in Gillian's movie is more or less synonymous with detentions in efficient but less than humane ways, rough interrogation and precision torture (all of which the detainees must pay out of their own pocket-accountability being paramount in this state apparatus). Another important theme is the inefficiency and inhumane coldness of bureaucracy . In the opening sequence, a fly falls into the cogs of an information system, causing an accidental misprint and the brutal arrest and information retrieval of the wrong man: they arrest and torture a someone called Tuttle, when really they're after a renegade heating engineer (played superbly by Robert De Niro), called Buttle. The main protagonist is also beset with problems caused by his calling of a government agency named Central Services (CS). These are supposed to fix the faulty air conditioning in his flat but can't do anything without the requisite application form. When sometime later the CS engineers (one played by Bob Hoskins) come back, it's with new technology that works as badly as the previous version. Here, De Niro comes to the rescue again (as he also does towards the end).", "id": "1973642", "sourceConcept": "TEMPERATURE", "targetConcept": "BUREAUCRACY", "type": "ANNOTATOR_EXAMPLES", "chain": "*:prep_of", "targets": [{"span1": [116, 117], "span2": [118, 119], "span1_word": "coldness", "span2_word": "bureaucracy", "score": "3.0", "label": "TEMPERATURE"}]}
